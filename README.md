Project Title: PLC Conveyor Simulation with Alarm Handling
Platform: RSLogix Micro Starter Lite + RSEmulate 500
Controller: MicroLogix 1000

This project simulates an industrial conveyor system using ladder logic. It demonstrates start/stop logic, sensor-triggered diverter control, jam detection using a delay timer, and latched alarm logic with manual reset. 
It uses memory bits (B3:0/0) and timers (T4:0) to create state-based behavior, and it was tested in RSEmulate 500. The design is scalable and closely mirrors logic seen in ControlLogix systems.
